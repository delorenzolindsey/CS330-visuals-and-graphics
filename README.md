Here in this ReadMe I would like to review the following questions from my assignment.



How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I need to think of the whole system and what it needs to accomplish. In doing this, I can create a main list and a other list of the functions that need to be created. Thinking of what the system must do helps start the process of thinking how to re-create the ideas after.


What design process did I follow to create this project?

In this project, the main result is an image that must be recreated. This would entail having a reference image to re-create, evaluating what shapes were needed to re-create the scene, and then learning (with my class) how to successfully re-create it with the code.



How do I appraoch developing programs?

After creating an outline of what needs to made, I then need to create the base part of the system, test and debug them, and then add details. This can be seen in this project from creating one shape to make sure I wrote the code correctly, then moving or re-shaping the object to match the scene.


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

My goal is to be appart of a career within computer science. I love learning about computers. It is a new found passion and I wish to persue a this feild with my creative thinking and hard working ideas. Computer science is very important for me to learn in order to begin my new journey to a future career path.


How can learning graphics help me in applying what I learned to my goals path?

At the moment, I am enjoying learn many new areas of computers and am unsure where I will end and discover my final career path. I feel learning as many branches within computer language helps me think the way a computer needs to be written. The more I can think the way a computer functions the more I will understand or be able to learn new and efficient ways to write my code.
